<p>Born in Australia, but with a British mother I have dual citizenship and have enjoyed travelling the world and working in a number of other countries. Highlights of my travels include working throughout the Middle East for five years, trekking to Everest Base Camp, kayaking with penguins in the Antarctic and spending time in the Ugandan forests looking for gorillas. Obviously 2020 has been a very different year and I look forward to a time when I can take my son with me to see more of this incredible world of ours.</p>

I really do believe in lifelong learning and have degrees in Science, Marketing, an MBA and am now adding IT to the collection! The unusual part of all my learning experiences is that I have never had the pleasure of studying full time - I have always worked at the same time as studying.

My current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The idea behind it is that you create something and leave it somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy to their day. Right now, I'm using rocks and acrylic paints and leaving small creatures around local parks and gardens for people to stumble across.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(3,133,139);">Interest in IT</h2>
I've always loved technology. The thrill of getting my hands on a new phone, laptop, music player and iterations upon these over time. But I had never understood IT, the careers it offered or the industry in general. I suppose on reflection, my interest was as an end user of IT - a consumer of devices and software. I had spent a lot of my career working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia, I took the opportunity to try out a new industry - telecommunications. Over time, I moved into a project role, and that was my first real exposure to what is possible with IT. I was put in charge of creating a new application that would enable our sales teams to follow leads, know where their deals were up to and generally manage their pipeline more effectively. I learned about EPICs, features, user stories and wire frames, a whole world I had never known existed. To help make the project more successful, my company employed a "translator" - someone who could help me turn the business requirements into an IT reality. I was hooked. When a friend reached out and asked if I would be interested in joining Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and here, I have found my home.
<p>

Despite working at Microsoft for five years now, my experience with IT is still really just peripheral. I know a little bit about everything and not a lot about anything, which is why I am here. My current role involves managing a deeply technical team who cover a broad range of technologies, from platform to security, data lakes to application development. In my previous roles, not having a background in technology wasn't an issue, but now I find myself needing to interrogate IT architectures, approve technical designs and completely out of my depth technically. I have always been a first principles kind of person, so I felt that an IT degree was the right kind of pathway for me. In doing my research RMIT had a great reputation with a degree option available online which matched the kind of areas I was interested in.
<p>
I'm hoping that through the course I will be able to build a strong grounding across the field of IT to enable me to better support my team.  What I am also looking forward to is the ability to follow particular streams of interest as I choose electives - getting really deep into specific areas that will aid with career progression. I have recently found a real passion for the area of security, as well as a fascination for the possibilities of data, AI and machine learning. These are spaces I am looking forward to growing my understanding of throughout the course of this degree.

The job:

<p></p>
<img src="Job description.png" alt="Image of job description for CIO">

<h3>What is the role really?</h3>
My ideal job is as a Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for one of the Public Service agencies in Australia. As a CIO or CTO you work with your team to build out the strategy around technology for the agency, aligned to the vision that the agency has for its future. This requires a breadth of knowledge across technology, as well as an understanding from a business perspective of how you can support the delivering of business vision through technical innovation. The role has equal parts business leadership and management along with technical service delivery. I appreciate that specifying that I want it to be in the Public Sector sounds odd, but there are a number of reasons for this:
<ul>
  <li>I started my working life in the Army and have a passion for public service. Service is part of my DNA and finding ways to support the growth of our economy and success of our country are things I am passionate about.</li>
	<li>The public sector is one area that still has opportunities for real transformational change in the technology space. Many agencies are carrying a huge amount of technical debt - old infrastructure and on-premises assets that they need to migrate from if they want to make use of the opportunities presented by the cloud. For many agencies, they are still only just scraping the surface of what could be possible.</li>
	<li>I love a challenge. I feel that one of my key skills is finding a way through organisational complexities and there are few organisations as complex to navigate as those of the public service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What skills, qualifications and experience is required for the role?</h3>
Each job description for CIO or CTO varies, depending on the agency or organisation, but common to most them tend to be the following:
<ul>
	<li>A relevant degree - Computer Science or Engineering tend to be preferred.</li>
	<li>Technical expertise, with depth of knowledge in areas such as security, cyber security and cloud services.</li>
	<li>Experience with executing transformational ICT programs and leading IT teams.</li>
	<li>In-depth knowledge of current and emerging IT trends.</li>
	<li>Strategic thinking and the ability to be pragmatic and analytical.</li>
	<li>The ability to develop creative solutions to complex problems and business requirements.</li>
	<li>Experience in leading continuous improvement programs and change management activities.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of how to build a performance-based culture which is aligned to strategic objectives (rewarding the right behaviours to drive the required outcomes).</li> 
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively internally and externally, as a partner, negotiator or influencer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My skills</h3>
I've been working in management roles for a number of years, across a few different industries. As a result I have skills and experiences that meet a number of the capabilities that are required for a CIO/CTO role.
<p>
In particular, I have experience in:

<ul>
	<li>Leading programs of change across diverse and distributed organisations.</li>
	<li>Agile and DevOps methodologies to support the continuous improvement element of program management.</li>
	<li>Building high performing teams as well as developing performance metrics that support and are aligned to business strategy.</li>
	<li>Developing business strategy, aligned to organisational vision, as well as building execution plans to support delivery of that strategy.</li>
	<li>Complex stakeholder management, both internal and external.</li>
	<li>Creative thinking – finding innovative solutions to complex problems.</li>
</ul>

My gaps when I look at my aspirational role are:
<ul>
  <li>Degree qualifications aligned to ICT.</li>
  <li>Technical expertise – no hands on experience with designing or delivering technology or technical programs.</li>
  <li>In-depth knowledge of IT trends. I have some knowledge and experience in this space, but more so as it relates to Microsoft, as opposed to the industry in general.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My plan</h3>
Doing this degree is part of my plan around closing my gaps towards my aspirational role. The degree itself will help to address one of the key criteria that the roles ask for, but it also plays a dual purpose. By completing the degree I will also be building a wide range of technical skills and knowledge. My plan is to complement the degree completion with opportunities to gain hands on experience, mentoring and interactions across the industry.
<p>

I’ve broken my development plan into three horizons:

<h4>Year 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Participate in the Program Architect Capability Accelerator- this is an internal program to help build capabilities around program architecture. It is a 12 month program that starts in January 2021</li>
  <li>Continue to spend time with customers, talking about their technical challenges and business priorities.</li>
  <li>Complete the AZ-500 exam to build a depth of knowledge around security.</li>
  <li>Attend an external IT conference to start building a broader knowledge of industry trends.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Year 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the AZ-300 and 301 exams – which are for Azure Architect.</li>
  <li>Shadow the CTO team to gain insights into their approach.</li>
  <li>Seek opportunities to speak at internal technical events on technical subject matter.</li>
  <li>Seek mentoring from current CIOs within the public sector.</li>
  <li>Seek opportunities to provide technical support for delivery activities with my current employer.</li>
  <li>Continue to attend external events, including joining relevant industry group to keep building connections and knowledge around industry trends.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Year 3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Seek opportunities to speak on technical subjects at external events.</li>
  <li>Explore role changes internally to support external aspirational role move, roles such as CTO, Practice Lead and those in the Solution Architecture Office would all make suitable jumping off points.</li>
  <li>Completion of Bechelor of IT</li>
</ul>

As expected, there is a lot more clarity for the next two years, versus the third year of the plan.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(5,215,225);">Personality profile</h2>
<h3>Test results</h3>

Below are the results from four online tests. The tests are designed to help identify personality profiles, learning styles and leadership styles.

<h4>Test 1 results - Myers-Briggs</h4>

For the Myers-Briggs or <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities test</a>  I tested as and ENFJ-A, as shown below. This is categorised as being a Protagonist.
<p></p>
<img src="Myers Briggs.png" alt="Image of text about Transformative Leadership" width="200" height="120">

<p></p>
A Protagonist is defined by the results as:
<blockquote cite="http://">
“Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community.”
</blockquote>


Strengths include:
<ul>
  <li>Tolerant</li>
  <li>Reliable</li>
  <li>Charismatic</li>
  <li>Altruistic</li>
  <li>Natural leaders</li>
</ul>


Weaknesses include:
<ul>
  <li>Overly idealistic</li>
  <li>Too selfelss</li>
  <li>Too sensitive</li>
  <li>Fluctuating self-esteem</li>
  <li>Struggle to make tough decisions</li>
</ul>



<h4>Test 2 results - Learning Styles</h4>
The diagram below shows the outcome of the <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">learning styles assessment</a>. You can read more about this form of assessment and the different styles here.
<p></p>

<img src="Learning styles.png" alt="Image of text about learning styles" width="450" height="200">
<p></p>
Learning styles are broken into four categories. My dominant learning styles is Pragmatist. The provided definition of a Pragmatist is:
<blockquote cite="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/">
  “Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world. Abstract concepts and games are of limited use unless they can see a way to put the ideas into action. Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. They may act quickly and confidently on ideas, getting straight to the point, and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.”

</blockquote>

<h4>Test 3 results - Leadership Styles</h4>
One of the tests I explored was the University of Southern California’s  <a href="https://eml.usc.edu/leadership-style-quiz">Interactive Leadership Style assessment</a>.

My result from the assessment was that I am a <a href="https://eml.usc.edu/blog/transformational-leadership-style">Transformative Leader</a>. The main characteristics of a Transformative Leader are:
<ul>
  <li>Curiosity</li>
  <li>Communicative</li>
  <li>Visionary</li>
  <li>Team first attitude</li>
  <li>Simplicity</li>
  <li>Charismatic</li>
  <li>Tolerance for risk</li>
</ul>

<img src="Transformative leader.png" alt="Image showing the summary of a transformative leader" width="270" height="200">

<h4>Test 4 results - DiSC</h4>
DiSC is a behavioural assessment which helps to identify your dominant style which is applied in teams or when leading. D stands for Dominance, i stands for Influence, S stands for Steadiness, and C stands for Conscientiousness.
In both my adapted and natural styles, I test most strongly as an I – Influence.
<blockquote cite="https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/disc-styles">
  “A person in this DiSC quadrant places emphasis on influencing or persuading others. They tend to be enthusiastic, optimistic, open, trusting, and energetic.”
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<h3>What do the results mean to me?</h3>

Myers-Briggs test is a test I have been doing for over 20 years. I started my career in the Australian Army and it was one of the entry requirements. I would estimate I have done this profile every few years and have always come out as an ENTJ. What is interesting, is that this time, I have come out as an ENFJ, and not by a little bit, I was 81% F. Is it really possible I have changed that significantly over time? I've been reflecting on this and the fact that over the last five years I have got married, had a child, and taken on management of large teams of people. All things that involve consideration and accommodation of others. The chances are that I have changed and adapted, or perhaps I have been supressing the F side of my personality all of this time and now it is allowed out. Either way, it is an interesting outcome and I believe an asset in the current role I play at work.

The Learning Styles results show a relative balance for me across three learning styles: pragmatist, activist and theorist. I can definitely relate to the first two and see this showing up in the ways in which I like to learn, and the ways in which I tend to deliver training to others. I have a preference for interaction, practical application and problem solving. The fact that I have very little reflector in my own learning styles is not surprising, but is definitely something I need to watch out for when working with others.

The leadership styles survey pegs me as a Transformative Leader, which is aligned to the Myers-Briggs categorisation as well. Curiosity, tolerance for risk and a team first attitude are definitely a core part of the way I approach managing my current team. For me, elements of transformational leadership such as simplicity, vision and communication are areas I continue to try and work and improve on as they are core to any good leadership.

DiSC is a profiling tool used extensively with my current employer. All managers are required to complete it, share it with their leadership and with their team, so I have included it here. The reason I particularly like this one is that it shows your natural style, as well as your adapted style. This to me makes a great deal of sense as leadership is very definitely situational, as is the kind of role you might play in a team. In both I come out as an Influencer, but what is interesting is the decrease in my dominance and increase in my conscientiousness in my adapted style. I work in a technical industry, where my role has a lot to do with quality. I also work with a large number of introverts, so it makes sense that I adapt my personal style, so as to have the best impact.

<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>

Looking at all four sets of results, it is clear that I like to lead, have a tendency to be a bit of an evangelist and crave focus and efficiency.  Each of the profiles completed also highlights terms such as positive, optimist and adaptable. As a result, in a team setting, I tend to be an organiser. I will want to get everyone together, to make sure they feel heard but that we are clear on what we are trying to achieve and that we are doing it in the most efficient manner.

<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>

I need to make sure that I am cognisant of others who perhaps have different learning styles and approaches to situations. Given the learning styles particularly, I will need to make sure that anyone who is a reflector is given the space and time to do their best work. Ideally it would be great to be able to share our learning and personality summaries with each other to help us make sure we are making the best use of everyone's talents and preferences. In practice, this may not work perfectly, but at least we will all be aware of people's preferences and can do our best to accommodate them.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(128,246,252);">Project concept</h2>

<h3>Hire me please - an Overview</h3>
How often have you read a job description and then failed to apply for the role because you didn’t think you met one of the listed criteria? There is an astonishing amount of research in this space around self-screening. An often quoted piece of research by Hewlett Packard found that women will not apply for a role unless they believe they meet 100% of the listed criteria, whereas men will apply when they meet around 60%. This means that employers are missing large parts of their target market through the

Inclusive hiring in the IT industry is a huge focus for employers at the moment, and the first real window into any organisation is their job description. This is the point at which companies, sometimes unknowingly, are turning off potential future employees. What they say, and how they say it is critical in the fight for talent.

Hire me please offers employers a tool to help them quickly and easily build inclusive job descriptions, optimised to attract the broadest range of potential candidates to their organisation. Using an automated interface, users simply select from pre-defined fields and the tool builds an inclusive job description, based around current best practice, removing as much bias as possible from the process and reducing the load on managers, HR and talent acquisition teams. Hire me please uses industry standards, organisational preferences and the data gathered through the application process to further refine and learn, in order to remain relevant over time.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
Over the last five years I have witnessed an increasing focus on attracting women into technical roles. Precise statistics in this space are hard to come by due to the way in which employers report on their staff. A 2015 report by the National Centre for Women & IT had women as 25% of the technical work force. I would suggest in many cases, it is much lower than this as women take up roles in service delivery, project management and leadership, which can often get grouped up by IT employers as 'technical'. In my own organisation, across Asia, our female technical talent accounts for just 7% of our employees. If we look at other areas of inclusive hiring such as neurodiversity, the statistics are even less reliable as they require self-identification and very often there is still considered to be a stigma attached.

So why does this really matter? Well, according to McKinsey, gender diverse companies are 15% more likely to have a financial performance above the industry mean, with the implication being that building diversity into an organisation can become a competitive differentiator. So why isn’t every organisation simply making sure that their workforce is diverse? Well, of course, it isn’t quite as simple as that.

<q cite="">Gender diverse companies are 15% more likely to have a financial performance above the industry mean.
(McKinsey 2015)</q>

In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6729896176390426624/">current study I am running</a> around inclusive hiring, 38% of respondents say that the number one reason they don’t apply for a job is that they thought they didn’t meet the listed criteria. The research shows that there is a large portion of the addressable market who are self screening, based on what they are reading in a job description and the Hewlett Packard research reinforces this.

The simplest change any organisation can make in terms of improving their talent pipeline is through tweaking their job descriptions. The challenge here is knowing what to change, what really matters and how to build all of that into a compelling, engaging and realistic job description. Most managers find themselves time poor and the recruitment function in many organisations is stretched across multiple roles, offshored and using a company standard that has existed for year. The simple act of including a non-essential degree requirement, or specifying that the job requires extensive travel, when in reality it is well planned and entirely manageable are just two examples of the kinds of things organisations add to their job requirements every day – without realising the proportion of candidates they have excluded through those simple actions.

Building an application to enable users to rapidly build highly inclusive job descriptions will immediately increase the number of candidates applying for roles, and give organisations greater diversity to choose from.

<h3>Description</h3>
On opening the application, users will have options they can select to determine the type of role they are recruiting for, and any critical parameters that have been set by the organisation (level, tenure, full time, part time, language).
The user will then be provided with a series of variables they can select from including:
<ul>
  <li>the kind of level of experience required for the role – graduate, entry level, senior, people manager</li>
  <li>any qualifications, certifications or accreditations that are really essential in order to perform the job,</li>
  <li>travel requirements</li>
  <li>security clearances</li>
</ul>

Having made their selections, the application will draw upon a pre-defined repository of content and build a new job description for the end user. The majority of this content will be pre-populated into an application library by the organisation and can include any content they already use.

The application will present the draft version of the job description in the interface to enable review and any additions to be made. Users can made edits directly into the draft through the interface.  Once the user is happy with their draft, they will submit it. The application will then run an assessment on the job description, providing it a mark out of 100 as to its inclusivity, and making any recommendations for changes that could be made to improve it. The tool will also provide the user with statistics around the potentially benefits of particular changes. For example, the application could tell the user that based on research, if they were to remove a degree requirement from the job description, applications would increase by 30%. This enables users to make data informed decisions around what to include or not include in their final version.

Recommendations that are accepted by the users will be fed back into the repository to enable the tool to iterate. For each future job description that meets the same or similar criteria in the initial screen, the application can make suggestions or show the most recent similar role that it produced.

With a link into the HR or recruitment tooling, the application can also create dashboards to show which job descriptions are being the most successful. This form of gamification encourages users to really focus on the content they are developing, as well as identifying successful starting points.

<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
The application and interface could be built in a number of ways.

The two main options would be:
1.	Using pre-existing SaaS products that are configured to support the requirements. This could be done using a PowerApps front end and user interface which then leverages Flow, Forms, a SharePoint repository, SQL databases and other Office suite tools to provide an output to an end user. The Machine Learning component of the tool could potentially be built using some of the out of the box connectors and capability in Azure, but would likely still need configuration from a Data Scientist to develop any custom algorithms required.
Limitations: The limitation of this approach is that it relies on all organisations who will want to use it to have licensing for the Microsoft tooling. It also limits customisation as the tooling lends itself more to configuration, rather than customisation.
Benefits: This approach will potentially reduce complexity and therefore cost as all the base coding is done and the work required will be a matter of configuration – creating the necessary connections between repositories, setting up a UI and leveraging built in platform capabilities.
2.	Building the application from the ground up in a platform agnostic way. This approach would require a much larger code base to be developed from scratch, but would also allow for more personalisation and flexibility. Leveraging an OSS code base might help to fast track this, so a combination of software such as Git, GitHub, Terraform/Azure DevOps and the preferred code base tooling, depending on the developer will be critical. Some kind of data storage will be required, depending on the Machine Learning capabilities that are built in. This in turn will need to be hosted and during the application development an approach will have to be agreed as to where the ML capability resides – whether it draws upon every job description being created, or whether it is dedicated to a singular organisation.
Limitations: The main challenge with this approach is that it will potentially be more time intensive. Having to built everything from the ground up will potentially take longer than configuring pre-existing tools.
Benefits: A lot more flexibility in the end product as it can be built exactly to specifications and can pull data from a lot more different sources.

<h3>Skills required</h3>

The skills required for this project are not particularly rare or hard to find. The majority of the work is standard application development, depending on the approach taken. The following are the main skills that will be required:

<ul>
  <li>Application developer</li>
  <li>UX designer</li>
  <li>Data engineer to support the data connections that will be needed</li>
  <li>Data scientist in order to build the necessary algorithms to enable the app to learn and iterate.</li>
</ul>

The only one of these that tends to be more specialist is the Data Scientist. If Hire Me Please is going to remain relevant, it needs to be able to learn from previous interactions so it can continue to build up to date and highly inclusive job descriptions.

<h3>Outcome</h3>

Using a combination of organisational requirements, in concert with current research in the field of inclusion, employers will have at their finger tips a tool that can create custom job descriptions, optimised to attract diverse talent to the organisation. Hire Me Please aims to take the guess work out of inclusive hiring and assist in creating a consistent hiring experience for candidates, whether the organisation is 10 people or 100,000 people.

By solving the challenges inherent in creating an unbiased job description, Hire Me Please will help organisations add greater diversity to their workforce, and therefore increase their potential for profitability.
