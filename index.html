A bit about me

Born in Australia, but with a British mother I have dual citizenship and have enjoyed travelling the world and working in a number of other countries. Highlights of my travels include working throughout the Middle East for five years, trekking to Everest Base Camp, kayaking with penguins in the Antarctic and spending time in the Ugandan forests looking for gorillas. Obviously 2020 has been a very different year and I look forward to a time when I can take my son with me to see more of this incredible world of ours.

I really do believe in lifelong learning and have degrees in Science, Marketing, an MBA and am now adding IT to the collection! The unusual part of all my learning experiences is that I have never had the pleasure of studying full time - I have always worked at the same time as studying.

My current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The idea behind it is that you create something and leave it somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy to their day. Right now, I'm using rocks and acrylic paints and leaving small creatures around local parks and gardens for people to stumble across.
