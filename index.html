<p>Born in Australia, but with a British mother I have dual citizenship and have enjoyed travelling the world and working in a number of other countries. Highlights of my travels include working throughout the Middle East for five years, trekking to Everest Base Camp, kayaking with penguins in the Antarctic and spending time in the Ugandan forests looking for gorillas. Obviously 2020 has been a very different year and I look forward to a time when I can take my son with me to see more of this incredible world of ours.</p>

I really do believe in lifelong learning and have degrees in Science, Marketing, an MBA and am now adding IT to the collection! The unusual part of all my learning experiences is that I have never had the pleasure of studying full time - I have always worked at the same time as studying.

My current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The idea behind it is that you create something and leave it somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy to their day. Right now, I'm using rocks and acrylic paints and leaving small creatures around local parks and gardens for people to stumble across.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(3,133,139);">Interest in IT</h2>
I've always loved technology. The thrill of getting my hands on a new phone, laptop, music player and iterations upon these over time. But I had never understood IT, the careers it offered or the industry in general. I suppose on reflection, my interest was as an end user of IT - a consumer of devices and software. I had spent a lot of my career working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia, I took the opportunity to try out a new industry - telecommunications. Over time, I moved into a project role, and that was my first real exposure to what is possible with IT. I was put in charge of creating a new application that would enable our sales teams to follow leads, know where their deals were up to and generally manage their pipeline more effectively. I learned about EPICs, features, user stories and wire frames, a whole world I had never known existed. To help make the project more successful, my company employed a "translator" - someone who could help me turn the business requirements into an IT reality. I was hooked. When a friend reached out and asked if I would be interested in joining Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and here, I have found my home.
<p>

Despite working at Microsoft for five years now, my experience with IT is still really just peripheral. I know a little bit about everything and not a lot about anything, which is why I am here. My current role involves managing a deeply technical team who cover a broad range of technologies, from platform to security, data lakes to application development. In my previous roles, not having a background in technology wasn't an issue, but now I find myself needing to interrogate IT architectures, approve technical designs and completely out of my depth technically. I have always been a first principles kind of person, so I felt that an IT degree was the right kind of pathway for me. In doing my research RMIT had a great reputation with a degree option available online which matched the kind of areas I was interested in.
<p>
I'm hoping that through the course I will be able to build a strong grounding across the field of IT to enable me to better support my team.  What I am also looking forward to is the ability to follow particular streams of interest as I choose electives - getting really deep into specific areas that will aid with career progression. I have recently found a real passion for the area of security, as well as a fascination for the possibilities of data, AI and machine learning. These are spaces I am looking forward to growing my understanding of throughout the course of this degree.

<p></p>
<img src="Job description.png" alt="Image of job description for CIO">

<h3>What is the role really?</h3>
My ideal job is as a Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for one of the Public Service agencies in Australia. As a CIO or CTO you work with your team to build out the strategy around technology for the agency, aligned to the vision that the agency has for its future. This requires a breadth of knowledge across technology, as well as an understanding from a business perspective of how you can support the delivering of business vision through technical innovation. The role has equal parts business leadership and management along with technical service delivery. I appreciate that specifying that I want it to be in the Public Sector sounds odd, but there are a number of reasons for this:
<ul>
  <li>I started my working life in the Army and have a passion for public service. Service is part of my DNA and finding ways to support the growth of our economy and success of our country are things I am passionate about.</li>
	<li>The public sector is one area that still has opportunities for real transformational change in the technology space. Many agencies are carrying a huge amount of technical debt - old infrastructure and on-premises assets that they need to migrate from if they want to make use of the opportunities presented by the cloud. For many agencies, they are still only just scraping the surface of what could be possible.</li>
	<li>I love a challenge. I feel that one of my key skills is finding a way through organisational complexities and there are few organisations as complex to navigate as those of the public service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What skills, qualifications and experience is required for the role?</h3>
Each job description for CIO or CTO varies, depending on the agency or organisation, but common to most them tend to be the following:
<ul>
	<li>A relevant degree - Computer Science or Engineering tend to be preferred.</li>
	<li>Technical expertise, with depth of knowledge in areas such as security, cyber security and cloud services.</li>
	<li>Experience with executing transformational ICT programs and leading IT teams.</li>
	<li>In-depth knowledge of current and emerging IT trends.</li>
	<li>Strategic thinking and the ability to be pragmatic and analytical.</li>
	<li>The ability to develop creative solutions to complex problems and business requirements.</li>
	<li>Experience in leading continuous improvement programs and change management activities.</li>
	<li>Knowledge of how to build a performance-based culture which is aligned to strategic objectives (rewarding the right behaviours to drive the required outcomes).</li> 
	<li>Ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively internally and externally, as a partner, negotiator or influencer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My skills</h3>
I've been working in management roles for a number of years, across a few different industries. As a result I have skills and experiences that meet a number of the capabilities that are required for a CIO/CTO role.
<p>
In particular, I have experience in:

<ul>
	<li>Leading programs of change across diverse and distributed organisations.</li>
	<li>Agile and DevOps methodologies to support the continuous improvement element of program management.</li>
	<li>Building high performing teams as well as developing performance metrics that support and are aligned to business strategy.</li>
	<li>Developing business strategy, aligned to organisational vision, as well as building execution plans to support delivery of that strategy.</li>
	<li>Complex stakeholder management, both internal and external.</li>
	<li>Creative thinking – finding innovative solutions to complex problems.</li>
</ul>

My gaps when I look at my aspirational role are:
<ul>
  <li>Degree qualifications aligned to ICT.</li>
  <li>Technical expertise – no hands on experience with designing or delivering technology or technical programs.</li>
  <li>In-depth knowledge of IT trends. I have some knowledge and experience in this space, but more so as it relates to Microsoft, as opposed to the industry in general.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My plan</h3>
Doing this degree is part of my plan around closing my gaps towards my aspirational role. The degree itself will help to address one of the key criteria that the roles ask for, but it also plays a dual purpose. By completing the degree I will also be building a wide range of technical skills and knowledge. My plan is to complement the degree completion with opportunities to gain hands on experience, mentoring and interactions across the industry.
<p>

I’ve broken my development plan into three horizons:

<h4>Year 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Participate in the Program Architect Capability Accelerator- this is an internal program to help build capabilities around program architecture. It is a 12 month program that starts in January 2021</li>
  <li>Continue to spend time with customers, talking about their technical challenges and business priorities.</li>
  <li>Complete the AZ-500 exam to build a depth of knowledge around security.</li>
  <li>Attend an external IT conference to start building a broader knowledge of industry trends.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Year 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the AZ-300 and 301 exams – which are for Azure Architect.</li>
  <li>Shadow the CTO team to gain insights into their approach.</li>
  <li>Seek opportunities to speak at internal technical events on technical subject matter.</li>
  <li>Seek mentoring from current CIOs within the public sector.</li>
  <li>Seek opportunities to provide technical support for delivery activities with my current employer.</li>
  <li>Continue to attend external events, including joining relevant industry group to keep building connections and knowledge around industry trends.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Year 3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Seek opportunities to speak on technical subjects at external events.</li>
  <li>Explore role changes internally to support external aspirational role move, roles such as CTO, Practice Lead and those in the Solution Architecture Office would all make suitable jumping off points.</li>
  <li>Completion of Bechelor of IT</li>
</ul>

As expected, there is a lot more clarity for the next two years, versus the third year of the plan.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(5,215,225);">Personality profile</h2>

Below are the results from four online tests. The tests are designed to help identify personality profiles, learning styles and leadership styles.

Test 1 results - Myers-Briggs

Protagonist

Test 2 results - Learning Styles

<img src="Learning styles.png" alt="Image of text about Transformative Leadership" width="450" height="200">

Test 3 results - Leadership Styles


Test 4 results - DiSC



What do the results mean to me?
Myers-Briggs test is a test I have been doing for over 20 years. I started my career in the Australian Army and it was one of the entry requirements. I would estimate I have done this profile every few years and have always come out as an ENTJ. What is interesting, is that this time, I have come out as an ENFJ, and not by a little bit, I was 81% F. Is it really possible I have changed that significantly over time? I've been reflecting on this and the fact that over the last five years I have got married, had a child, and taken on management of large teams of people. All things that involve consideration and accommodation of others. The chances are that I have changed and adapted, or perhaps I have been supressing the F side of my personality all of this time and now it is allowed out. Either way, it is an interesting outcome and I believe an asset in the current role I play at work.

The Learning Styles results show a relative balance for me across three learning styles: pragmatist, activist and theorist. I can definitely relate to the first two and see this showing up in the ways in which I like to learn, and the ways in which I tend to deliver training to others. I have a preference for interaction, practical application and problem solving. The fact that I have very little reflector in my own learning styles is not surprising, but is definitely something I need to watch out for when working with others.

The leadership styles survey pegs me as a Transformative Leader, which is aligned to the Myers-Briggs categorisation as well. Curiosity, tolerance for risk and a team first attitude are definitely a core part of the way I approach managing my current team. For me, elements of transformational leadership such as simplicity, vision and communication are areas I continue to try and work and improve on as they are core to any good leadership.

DiSC is a profiling tool used extensively with my current employer. All managers are required to complete it, share it with their leadership and with their team, so I have included it here. The reason I particularly like this one is that it shows your natural style, as well as your adapted style. This to me makes a great deal of sense as leadership is very definitely situational, as is the kind of role you might play in a team. In both I come out as an Influencer, but what is interesting is the decrease in my dominance and increase in my conscientiousness in my adapted style. I work in a technical industry, where my role has a lot to do with quality. I also work with a large number of introverts, so it makes sense that I adapt my personal style, so as to have the best impact.


How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?
Looking at all four sets of results, it is clear that I like to lead, have a tendency to be a bit of an evangelist and crave focus and efficiency.  Each of the profiles completed also highlights terms such as positive, optimist and adaptable. As a result, in a team setting, I tend to be an organiser. I will want to get everyone together, to make sure they feel heard but that we are clear on what we are trying to achieve and that we are doing it in the most efficient manner.


How should I take this into account when forming a team?
I need to make sure that I am cognisant of others who perhaps have different learning styles and approaches to situations. Given the learning styles particularly, I will need to make sure that anyone who is a reflector is given the space and time to do their best work. Ideally it would be great to be able to share our learning and personality summaries with each other to help us make sure we are making the best use of everyone's talents and preferences. In practice, this may not work perfectly, but at least we will all be aware of people's preferences and can do our best to accommodate them.
