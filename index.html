<p>Born in Australia, but with a British mother I have dual citizenship and have enjoyed travelling the world and working in a number of other countries. Highlights of my travels include working throughout the Middle East for five years, trekking to Everest Base Camp, kayaking with penguins in the Antarctic and spending time in the Ugandan forests looking for gorillas. Obviously 2020 has been a very different year and I look forward to a time when I can take my son with me to see more of this incredible world of ours.</p>

I really do believe in lifelong learning and have degrees in Science, Marketing, an MBA and am now adding IT to the collection! The unusual part of all my learning experiences is that I have never had the pleasure of studying full time - I have always worked at the same time as studying.

My current hobby is known as "abandoned art". The idea behind it is that you create something and leave it somewhere for someone else to find, ideally bringing some joy to their day. Right now, I'm using rocks and acrylic paints and leaving small creatures around local parks and gardens for people to stumble across.

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(3,133,139);">Interest in IT</h2>
I've always loved technology. The thrill of getting my hands on a new phone, laptop, music player and iterations upon these over time. But I had never understood IT, the careers it offered or the industry in general. I suppose on reflection, my interest was as an end user of IT - a consumer of devices. I had spent a lot of my career working in law and overseas and on returning to Australia, I took the opportunity to try out a new industry - telecommunications. Over time, I moved into a project role, and that was my first real exposure to what is possible with IT. I was put in charge of creating a new application that would enable our sales teams to follow leads, know where their deals were up to and generally manage their pipeline more effectively. I learned about EPICs, features, user stories and wire frames, a whole world I had never known existed. To help make the project more successful, my company employed a "translator" - someone who could help me turn the business requirements into an IT reality. I was hooked. When a friend reached out and asked if I would be interested in joining Microsoft, it was a no brainer, and here, I have found my home.
<p>

Despite working at Microsoft for five years now, my experience with IT is still really just peripheral. I know a little bit about everything and not a lot about anything, which is why I am here. My current role involves managing a deeply technical team who cover a broad range of technologies, from platform to security, data lakes to application development. In my previous roles, not having a background in technology wasn't an issue, but now I find myself needing to interrogate IT architectures, approve technical designs and completely out of my depth technically. I have always been a first principles kind of person, so I felt that an IT degree was the right kind of pathway for me. In doing my research RMIT had a great reputation with a degree option available online which matched the kind of areas I was interested in.
<p>
I'm hoping that through the course I will be able to build a strong grounding across the field of IT to enable me to better support my team.  What I am also looking forward to is the ability to follow particular streams of interest as I choose electives - getting really deep into specific areas that will aid with career progression. I have recently found a real passion for the area of security, as well as a fascination for the possibilities of data, AI and machine learning. These are spaces I am looking forward to growing my understanding of throughout the course of this degree.

The job: CIO in the Public Service

<h3>What is the role really?</h3>
My ideal job is as a Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for one of the Public Service agencies in Australia. As a CIO or CTO you work with your team to build out the strategy around technology for the agency, aligned to the vision that the agency has for its future. This requires a breadth of knowledge across technology, as well as an understanding from a business perspective of how you can support the delivering of business vision through technical innovation. The role has equal parts business leadership and management along with technical service delivery. I appreciate that specifying that I want it to be in the Public Sector sounds odd, but there are a number of reasons for this:

	• I started my working life in the Army and have a passion for public service. Giving back is part of my DNA and finding ways to support the growth of our economy and success of our country are things I am passionate about.
	• The public sector is one area that still has opportunities for real change in the technology space. Many agencies are carrying a huge amount of technical debt - old infrastructure and on-premises assets that they need to migrate from if they want to make use of the opportunities presented by the cloud. For many agencies, they are still only just scraping the surface of what could be possible.
	• I love a challenge. I feel that one of my key skills is finding a way through organisational complexities and there are few organisations as complex to navigate as those of the public service.


<h3>What skills, qualifications and experience is required?</h3>
Each job description for CIO or CTO varies, depending on the agency or organisation, but common to most them tend to be the following:

	• A relevant degree - Computer Science or Engineering tend to be preferred
	• Technical expertise, with depth of knowledge in areas such as security, cyber security and cloud services.
	• Experience with executing transformational ICT programs and leading IT team.
	• In-depth knowledge of current and emerging IT trends.
	• Strategic thinking and the ability to be pragmatic and analytical.
	• The ability to develop creative solutions to complex problems and business requirements.
	• Experience in leading continuous improvement programs and change management activities.
	• Knowledge of how to build a performance-based culture which is aligned to strategic objectives (rewarding the right behaviours to drive the required outcomes). 
	• Ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively internally and externally, as a partner, negotiator or influencer.
